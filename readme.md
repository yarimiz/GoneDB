# GoneDB

GoneDB is a lightweight, in-memory key-value store inspired by Redis.
It is developed as part of a process of learning Go :)

## Features

- **In-Memory Storage**: Store and retrieve data quickly with an in-memory data structure.
- **Auth**: Built-in authentication mechanism to manage users with permissions, per DB.
- **Key-Value Pairs**: Supports basic operations on string-based key-value pairs.
- **Command Interface**: Similar to Redis, GoneDB has simple command-line operations for interacting with the database.
- **No Persistence**: Yes, it's a feature. Until I'll decide to change it
